Hi,
I upgraded today to roundcubemail-1.3.9 (comming from roundcubemail-1.2.5).
I only extracted the roundcubemail-1.2.5-complete.tar.gz and copy over the config.inc.php from my old install.

But when I login, the menu was looking wired.... In the Browser`s Developer Tools I saw, that the overlapping content comes from the div id=uploadform.

My used language is de_DE.
