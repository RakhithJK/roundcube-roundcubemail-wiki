# Roundcube Documentation

## Code Layout

### Controller
 * The controller (index.php) creates an instance of the main application class `rcmail` which is a singleton
 * Configuration is read from `config/config.inc.php` and `config/defailts.inc.php`
 * Login to the IMAP server (-> user authentication) is triggered from index.php
 * Basic sequence: `rcmail::get_instance()` -> `rcmail::load_gui()` -> `new rcmail_template()` -> `rcmail_template::send()`

### Tasks & Actions
 * index.php limits tasks to set list
 * and includes a specific PHP file (`from program/steps/<taskname>/`) for the requested action

### View
 * Templates for each task/action are stored in `skins/default/templates`
 * In templates `<roundcube: />` tokens will be replaced with dynamic content by the `rcmail_template` class
 * All absolute paths (starting with "/") within the templates will be altered to point to the skin directory
 * AJAX requests are handled by the rcube_json_output class which is created by `rcmail::init_json()`

## Directory structure

The root folder of a Roundcube installation contains the following folders:

* `config/`
   Home of the local configurations files
* `program/`
   All application files are stored in this folder.
   These files will be replaced when upgrading the installation.
* `program/js/`
   Client JavaScript files
* `program/lib/Roundcube`
   The Roundcube framework classes which can be used outside the webmail package
* `program/lib/*`
   External libraries used for Roundcube
* `program/include/`
   Webmail-specific classes and core functions
* `program/localization/`
   Contains subfolders with localization files.
* `program/steps/`
   Include files for every task/action
* `plugins/`
   Container for all plugins. Each plugins is represented in a separate subfolder
* `bin/`
   Commandline tools and shell scripts for internal use and maintainance
* `logs/`
   Contains log files. This folder has to be writable for the webserver.
* `temp/`
   Location of temporary saved files such as attachments and cache files
   This folder has to be writable for the webserver.
* `skins/`
   Contains skin subfolders
* `SQL/`
   SQL files for database initialization and updates. Only needed for installations or upgrades.


## Important files

All requests from the client are sent to _index.php_. This index file - together with the `rcmail` class loads all core components and establishes connections to the database and the IMAP server. It analyzes the request and then includes one of the step files. Direct access to `config`, `log` and `temp` folders should not be permitted.

For Apache webservers which allow local overrides, the `.htaccess` file includes some PHP configuration settings as well as file access directives. More `.htaccess` files are located in the protected folders mentioned above.
