# Translations

Roundcube is currently available in more than 70 languages.

We have moved our translations to *Transifex* where you can all contribute and help to keep the translations up-to-date. Go to [transifex.com](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/roundcube-webmail/) and register yourself as a Transifex user. In order to start translating, you have to become a member or even coordinator of the translation team for your language. To do so, choose the language from the list and then click "Join team" on the upper right part of the overview page. You're request will be proceeded as fast as possible. If you're the fist applicant for a language, you'll become the maintainer of that language team and applications from other translators will also be sent to you.

The translations made on the Transifex platform will periodically be synched back into the Roundcube git repository.
