## Suggested Best Practices for Roundcube Developers

### 1. Keyboard Navigation

Every UI element SHALL be operable with the keyboard. That includes:

 * Receiving focus using the tab key
 * Clearly indicate focused status
 * Action is executable by pressing enter or space
 * Instructions are available if keyboard navigation for a specific widget differs from the standard actions

### 2. Annotated Content Structure

 * The individual areas of the application UI SHALL be annotated with section headers and/or appropriate `role` attributes.
 * The order and nesting of elements in the DOM should be reasonable for a top-down reading although elements are absolutely positioned with CSS.

### 3. Full Link Texts for Icon Buttons

Links which are rendered as graphical buttons with icons SHALL have full and explaining link texts nonetheless. Hide the text with `text-indent:-5000px` when rendering an icon button with CSS backgrounds or leave the link tag empty and set the `title` attribute.

### 4. Labelled Input Elements

Each input element (e.g. text box, drop-down selection, etc.) SHALL be clearly labelled with a description about the expected information to be entered. Either using `<label>` elements or `title` attributes.

### 5. Expanded State in Control Buttons

For buttons expanding/collapsing hidden UI elements or opening menus, set the `aria-expanded` attribute according to the state of the controlled element. This can be for buttons opening menus or toggling some hidden options.

A button which opens a popup menu should use the following attributes:

    <a ... onclick="return rcmail.command('menu-open','<menu-id>',this,event);
      aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false" aria-owns="<menu-element-id>">

And containers representing a popup menu typically look like this:

    <div id="menu-id" class="popupmenu" aria-hidden="true">
        <h3 id="aria-label-menutitle" class="voice">A Sample Menu</h3>
        <ul id="menu-element-id" class="toolbarmenu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="aria-label-menutitle">
            <li role="menuitem"><roundcube:button command="..." /></li>
            <li role="menuitem"><roundcube:button command="..." /></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

### 6. Autocompletion Elements

For text elements that trigger autocompletion suggestions on keypress, add the following attributes: `aria-autocomplete="list" aria-expanded="false"`. Upon results being displayed, add `aria-haspopup="true"` and `aria-owns="<listbox-id>"` to the input element and reset them once the list is hidden again. The arrow keys shall then move through the suggestions and either _Enter_ or _Tab_ copies the selected item into the text box. In order to make screen readers speak the selected item, set the `aria-activedescendant="<selected-option-element-id>"` attribute to the input element.

Read [Marco's Easy ARIA Tip #7](http://www.marcozehe.de/2014/03/11/easy-aria-tip-7-use-listbox-and-option-roles-when-constructing-autocomplete-lists/) for more in-depth information.

### 7. Use common Widget Objects

For lists, treelists, dialogs or other standard UI components, use the javascript widget objects Roundcube ships with or jQuery UI widgets. Both have accessibility support already built in.

 * For hierarchical lists: `rcube_treelist_widget` from treelist.js
 * For record lists: `rcube_list_widget` from list.js
 * For buttons: `<roundcube:button command="..." />` in skin templates
 * For menus: `rcmail.command('menu-open')` and `rcmail.command('menu-close')`
 * For dialogs: `rcmail.show_popup_dialog()`or jQuery UI `$.dialog()`
 * For tabbed UI elements, use jQuery UI `$.tabs()`

### 8. Updating Status Texts Declared as Live Region

Parts of the UI that get updated during the interaction with the application (e.g. display of "Messages 1 to 20 of 356") should have the [aria-live](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-live) attribute to let screen readers read changes to the user.
For updated status texts, the following attributes are appropriate: `aria-live="polite" aria-relevant="text"`


## Methods to Verify Accessibility

(extract from http://www.bitvtest.de/bitvtest/das_testverfahren_im_detail/pruefschritte.html)

### Keyboard Navigation

Open the page in your browser. Use the _Tab_ and/or _Arrow_ keys to move focus through the UI. Check the following:

 * Every button and form element should be reachable using the keyboard.
 * Focused element should be clearly visible/highlighted. You should always know which element has the focus.
 * Action of the UI elements (e.g. button click) can be executed by the keyboard (by hitting _Enter_ or _Space_).
 * When an action opens a menu or a dialog, the first element of that menu/dialog should get the focus.
 * _Esc_ closes menus and dialogs and sets focus back to the opening button.

### Content Structure and Section Headings

In Firefox's Web Developer Toolbar select _CSS > Disable Styles > Disable All Styles_.[[BR]]
Check the document structure for

 * Correct Headings (h1 - h6). The page requires at least one h1
 * Sane order of the UI components
 * Every button should be accessible as textual link
 * Complex forms should be structured with `<fieldset>` elements containing `<legend>` titles

### Landmarks and Frame Title

In Firefox's Juicy Studio Accessibility Toolbar, select _ARIA > Document Landmarks_.[[BR]]
Check the annotated areas for correct assignments:

 * There should be one `main` role area
 * Navigational elements should be labelled with `navigation`
 * Search boxes should have the role `search`

In Internet Explorer's Web Accessibility Toolbar select _Frames > Frame Name / Title_.[[BR]]
Check that every iframe has a meaningful title set.
 
### Listings as HTML List Elements

In Internet Explorer's Web Accessibility Toolbar select _Structure > List Elements_.[[BR]]
Check if all listings, especially hierarchical ones are represented with `<ul>` and `<ol>` elements 

### Data Table Structure

In Internet Explorer's Web Accessibility Toolbar select _Tables > Show Data Tables_.[[BR]]
Check if all column and row headers are correctly marked up with `<th>` elements.

In Firefox's Accessibility Evaluation Toolbar, select _Navigation > Tata Tables_.[[BR]]
Navigate through the table using the Left/Right/Up/Down buttons and check the headers and content listing.

### Icons with Title Attributes

Every UI element represented by an icon or color graphic should have a descriptive `title` attribute.[[BR]]
To check, move the mouse over every icon and wait for the tooltip to show up.

### Labelled Form Elements

Every form input element should have a linked `<label>` element or `title` attribute.

* For `<label>` elements, open the page in your browser and click on the text describing an input field. If correctly linked, the input field gets the focus upon click on the label.
* If there's no visible text describing the form element, move the mouse over the element and wait for the `title` to be displayed as tooltip.

### Voice Output

Enable [Chromevox](http://www.chromevox.com) in Chrome or [Voiceover](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/enable-voiceover-mac-46095.html) on Mac OS X. Use the keyboard to navigate through the application and listen to the voice output. The spoken element is highlighted in the browser window. Voiceover also has an option to mute audio speech and displays the text on the screen.


## Questions and Answers

 *Role or additional actions for messages (loading, confirmation, errors)?*::
  [ARIA18](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140408/ARIA18): Using `aria-alertdialog` to Identify Errors. [[BR]]
  [ARIA Roles](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#alert) Set `role="alert"` for spoken messages and `role="status"` for non-spoken background status information. [[BR]]
  Roundcube's internal message system (`rcmail.display_message(...)` already implement these.

 *Best order of content blocks (topnav, toolbar, folders, messages)?*::
  ?

 *Toolbar navigation (focus shift) with cursor keys?*::
  Marco’s accessibility blog posts suggest to navigate with cursor keys in toolbars. Are Roundcube's toolbars really of the type where that would be expected?
